3. **Email Integration**: Investor's Assemble facilitates communication between entrepreneurs and investors by providing an integrated email system. Users can connect and correspond securely within the platform, streamlining the initial contact and collaboration process.

4. **News Service Integration**: To enhance the platform's value proposition, Investor's Assemble integrates a news service API. This integration provides users with access to relevant information about stocks, finance markets, industry trends, and other news that can impact investment decisions.

## Technology Stack

Investor's Assemble is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js

This powerful MERN stack allows for efficient development, seamless integration between frontend and backend components, and the utilization of JavaScript across the entire application.

## User Authentication and Authorization

User authentication and authorization in Investor's Assemble are handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT enables secure user login and access control by generating tokens that verify the user's identity and grant access to protected resources within the application.

## Challenges and Overcoming Obstacles

During the development process, the team faced challenges with deploying the application on Heroku. While initially attempting to host the application on Heroku, some technical issues arose. To overcome this obstacle, the team explored alternative hosting options or resolved the technical issues to ensure a smooth deployment process.

## Future Enhancements

Currently, there are no specific plans for future enhancements or additions to the Investor's Assemble application. However, based on user feedback and evolving market needs, the platform could be expanded to include additional features such as chat functionality, advanced search filters, investment portfolio management, or integration with other financial services APIs.

Investor's Assemble presents a unique opportunity for entrepreneurs to connect with potential investors and for investors to discover promising startups. By leveraging the MERN stack and incorporating key features such as startup updates, search capabilities, email integration, and news service integration, the application empowers users to build meaningful connections in the dynamic world of startup investing.
